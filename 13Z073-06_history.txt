-----[ Revision 1.4 ]-----
[ 2007-09-25 13:55:25 by cs ]
driver:
   fixed:
     - M_getstat(STATUS): only read status from HW when status queue empty
                          return status from queue when queue full
       reason: once queue full M_getstat would just return an error
               and there was no way to empty it
   changed:
     - default status queue size now 10
       reason: double click on P&T sometimes lead ot queue overflow already
Z073_SIMP:
   fixed:
     - refined error handling when queue full reported from driver
       now all status messages are read once a signal is received
       reason: on multiple press/return events (multiple messages) only one
               was read, the other ones where left in the driver (overflow)
     - refined cleanup of signals in case of errors (cosmetic)

-----[ Revision 1.3 ]-----
[ 2006-06-08 17:01:23 by cs ]
driver:   changed ADDRSPACE_SIZE to 16 (Chameleon BBIS reports real size now)
z73_simp: fixed: all M_getstat and printf removed from signal handler

-----[ Revision 1.2 ]-----
[ 2006-02-28 16:24:04 by cs ]
changed:
    - driver doesn't support M_read any more (was redundant)
fixed:
    - getStatus always clears all status bits
    - example: - don't consider Z073_ERR_NO_STATUS as actual error
